# Antithetic sampling has more variance than the stratified samipling
# Using this to estimate the area under the curve
# Drawing extreme values, doubles the extreme valeus (parabola), which increases variance
# Nice thing is that antithetic sampling is mean preservant
# Mean of the antithetic sampling distribution is the area under the curve - jupynb (sum(samples))/num_trials
